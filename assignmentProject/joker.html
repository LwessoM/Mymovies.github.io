        <h2>Why I Love Joker</h2>
        <div class="movie-details">
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2019 | <strong>Rating:</strong> R</p>
            <p><strong>Director:</strong> Todd Phillips</p>
            <p><strong>Stars:</strong> Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz</p>
        </div>

        <p>Joker is a gripping psychological thriller that delves deep into the psyche of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man disregarded by society. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a haunting performance, capturing Arthur's slow descent into madness as he transforms into the Joker, Gotham’s most infamous villain.</p>

        <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Society and Mental Health: Joker highlights how society’s neglect and lack of compassion can lead to tragic consequences.</li>
            <li>The Blurred Line Between Hero and Villain: The film challenges traditional notions of good and evil, showing that even villains can have human motivations and vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Isolation and Loneliness: Arthur’s alienation from the world around him reflects the deep loneliness many people experience, especially those struggling with mental health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Memorable Scenes</h3>
        <img src="stock_img/joker-stairs.png" alt="Joker stairs scence">
        <p>One of the most iconic scenes in Joker is the moment Arthur, now fully transformed into the Joker, dances on the stairs in Gotham. The scene symbolizes his acceptance of his darker side, and Joaquin Phoenix’s performance is unforgettable.</p>

        <h3>Why This Movie Resonates With Me</h3>
        <p>What stands out about Joker is how it humanizes a character typically seen as pure evil. The film invites the audience to empathize with Arthur’s struggles, even as he descends into villainy. It forces us to reflect on society's role in shaping individuals like Arthur and raises important questions about mental health and compassion. For me, Joker is a powerful reminder of how fragile the line between sanity and madness can be.</p>
